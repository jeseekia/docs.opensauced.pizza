## 🚀 Live release environments

- [api.opensauced.pizza](https://api.opensauced.pizza/docs)
- [beta.api.opensauced.pizza](https://beta.api.opensauced.pizza/docs)

## 📖 Prerequisites

In order to run the project we need the following software binaries installed on our development machines:

- `node>=16.7.0`
- `npm>=8.0.0`
- `docker>=20.10.12`
- `supabase>=0.18.0`

You also need the `.env` environment file added to your repo for the project to run. To get it, kindly contact @open-sauced/triage team.
> Note: For Windows users, the `API_HOST` key's value in the `.env` file should be `127.0.0.1`, instead of `0.0.0.0`, so that the project can run correctly on localhost.

## 🖥️ Local development

To install the application:

```shell
npm ci
```

To start a local copy of the app on port `3001`:

```shell
npm run start:dev
```

### 🧪 Test

For running the test suite, use the following command. Since the tests run in watch mode by default, some users may encounter errors about too many files being open. In this case, it may be beneficial to [install watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html).

```shell
npm test
```

You can request a coverage report by running the following command:

```shell
npm run test:coverage
```

For writing tests, the rule is move business or service logic to the lib folder and write unit tests. Logic that needs to be in a React component, then leverage tools like [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) or [Vitest mocking](https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking.html) to write tests.

### 📦 Docker builds

A development preview can also be run from docker:

```shell
docker build -t api.opensauced.pizza .
docker run -p 8080:3001 api.opensauced.pizza
```

Alternatively you can pull the production container and skip all builds:

```shell
docker run -dit -p 8080:3001 ghcr.io/open-sauced/api.opensauced.pizza
```

### 🎨 Code linting

To check the code and styles quality, use the following command:

```shell
npm run lint
```

This will also display during development, but not break on errors.

To fix the linting errors, use the following command:

```shell
npm run format
```

It is advised to run this command before committing or opening a pull request.

### 📕 Types

We have a couple of scripts to check and adjust missing types.

In order to dry run what types would be added to `package.json`:

```shell
npm run types:auto-check 
```

In order to add any missing types to `package.json`:

```shell
npm run types:auto-add
```

### 🚀 Production deployment

A production deployment is a complete build of the project, including the build of the static assets.

```shell
npm run build
```

## 🔑 Database commands

The API is configured to connect to a local Docker backed PostGres instance however 
you can also connect to a remote Supabase instance by logging in via the UI and 
copying the connection string from the settings page.

### Managing supabase migrations

First thing we have to do for [local development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development) is start the studio locally at [localhost:54321](http://localhost:54321):

```shell
npm run db:start
```

### Make changes

If we are adding a new table structure, first do it visually in the Supabase Studio and test locally.

Check the migration difference with the following command:

```shell
npm run db:changes
```

If everything is fine we can run the following command to apply the changes to the database:

```shell
npm run db:commit add_table_name
```

### Test changes

Simplest way to test the migrations are working is to reset the local database:

```shell
npm run db:reset
```

### Push changes

If everything is fine we can push the changes to the remote database:

```shell
npm run db:push
```
